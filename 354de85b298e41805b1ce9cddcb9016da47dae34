{"version":1,"timestamp":"2026-02-11T12:00:00Z","prompt":"Fix: kausality handler should start a fresh trace when the current user is not in the parent's updaters. When a user directly mutates a child object, the handler always prepends the parent's trace. Only prepend the parent trace if the current user IS in the parent's controllers. Add the current user to childUpdaters before calling Detect since spec change is already confirmed, so IsControllerByHash Case 2 intersection works correctly."}
