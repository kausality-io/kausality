{"version":1,"timestamp":"2026-02-11T10:00:00Z","prompt":"Add audit annotations to admission webhook responses. Return kausality-relevant information (decision, drift, mode, lifecycle-phase, drift-resolution, trace) via AdmissionResponse.AuditAnnotations so they appear in the Kubernetes audit log. Drop controller-hash and user-hash (internal). The trace alone is sufficient, no need for separate parent or trace-origin annotations."}
